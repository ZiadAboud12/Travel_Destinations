        <h2>Its History</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square, Cairo, was established in 1902, designed by French architect Marcel Dourgnon. It became one of the first and largest museums dedicated solely to ancient Egyptian antiquities, symbolizing Egypt's commitment to preserving its cultural heritage. The museum's neoclassical architecture made it an iconic landmark, allowing it to showcase invaluable artifacts that had previously been vulnerable to theft and foreign collectors.
